# Cosmofy - Space Exploration App

## Overview

Cosmofy is a modern web application that provides an immersive space exploration experience by integrating real-time data from various NASA and space APIs. The application features a cosmic-themed design with animated elements, real-time space tracking, and educational content about space phenomena.

## System Architecture

### Full-Stack TypeScript Application

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, styled using Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui components
- **Backend**: Express.js server with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for data persistence
- **Build System**: Vite for frontend bundling, esbuild for server compilation

### Architectural Pattern

The application follows a monorepo structure with shared TypeScript types and schemas:

- `client/` - React frontend application
- `server/` - Express.js backend API
- `shared/` - Common types, schemas, and utilities

## Key Components

### Frontend Architecture

- **Component Library**: Custom UI components built on Radix UI primitives
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state management
- **Animations**: GSAP for advanced animations and scroll-triggered effects
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom cosmic color palette and design system

### Backend Architecture

- **API Layer**: RESTful API endpoints organized in `/api` routes
- **Data Access**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL for structured data storage
- **External Integrations**: NASA API services for real-time space data
- **Storage Abstraction**: Interface-based storage layer supporting both in-memory and database implementations

### Database Schema

The application tracks various space-related entities:

- **APOD Images**: Astronomy Picture of the Day data
- **ISS Tracking**: Position, passes, and crew information
- **Aurora Forecasts**: Geomagnetic activity and visibility predictions
- **Asteroids**: Near-Earth object tracking
- **Space Missions**: Active mission information

## Data Flow

1. **Client Requests**: React components use TanStack Query to fetch data from API endpoints
2. **API Layer**: Express routes handle requests and coordinate with external APIs
3. **External APIs**: NASA APIs and space weather services provide real-time data
4. **Data Persistence**: Structured data is cached in PostgreSQL via Drizzle ORM
5. **Real-time Updates**: Polling intervals ensure fresh data for dynamic content

## External Dependencies

### NASA and Space APIs

- NASA APOD API for daily astronomy images
- ISS tracking APIs for position and pass predictions
- NOAA Space Weather API for aurora forecasting
- NASA NEO API for asteroid tracking

### Key Libraries

- **UI Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM and Neon serverless
- **Animations**: GSAP with ScrollTrigger plugin
- **HTTP Client**: TanStack Query for API state management
- **Validation**: Zod for schema validation
- **Icons**: Lucide React and React Icons

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment

- Replit integration with hot reload via Vite dev server
- PostgreSQL database provisioned through Replit modules
- Environment variables for API keys and database URLs

### Production Build

- Frontend: Vite builds optimized static assets
- Backend: esbuild compiles TypeScript server code
- Deployment: Configured for Replit's autoscale deployment target

### Environment Configuration

- Database connection via `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
- NASA API key via `NASA_API_KEY` or `VITE_NASA_API_KEY`
- Development/production mode switching via `NODE_ENV`

## Local Development

A comprehensive `LOCAL_SETUP.md` guide has been created for replicating the entire Cosmofy platform locally. The guide includes complete setup instructions, environment configuration, API key requirements, and troubleshooting steps for all 15 space exploration features.
